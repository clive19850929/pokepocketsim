# Operations Notes

## Dependency management (pip-tools)

1. Install/update pip-tools:
   ```powershell
   python -m pip install -U pip pip-tools
   ```
2. Update pinned requirements (CPU torch by default):
   ```powershell
   pip-compile requirements-torch-cpu.in -o requirements-torch-cpu.txt
   pip-compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt -c requirements-torch-cpu.txt
   ```
   Or run the helper script:
   ```powershell
   scripts\compile_requirements.ps1
   ```
3. Install from pinned requirements:
   ```powershell
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Note: `requirements.txt` is generated by pip-compile. Edit `.in` files only.

## Diff + log collection (Cursor)

After changes, save the diff so it can be attached with Cursor logs/debug dumps:

```powershell
git diff > fixes\issue_YYYYMMDD_short_desc.diff
```

Attach `fixes\*.diff` together with `run_*.log` and any `debug_dump_*.json` files when reporting issues.
